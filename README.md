# SIFF Film Filters

The Seattle International Film Festival (SIFF) has a film finder on their website that contains good information about the movies for a given year. But it doesn't let you filter by location, date, or time. I quickly hacked this together for my partner to schedule which films she wants to see--maybe somebody else will find it useful, too. You can track your favorites and note which films you're attending. There are no accounts, so the attending is just tracked on a per-device basis in local storage.
